    ca.crt: <ca crt>
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: vault-ca-secret

- **mode**: Mode contains unseal mechanism. Currently available mechanism are:
  - **kubernetesSecret** : Unseal key and root token are stored in kubernetes secret. This secret is created by unsealer.

    spec:
      unsealer:
        mode:

    kubernetesSecret contains following fields:
      - **secretName** (string): Unsealer will create secret of this name.

## VaultServer Status
